#summary why does open source medical software make sense?

= Introduction =

Let's start with the typical product manager's job description:

 * Ability to write vague, grammatically incorrect clinical requirements
 * Ability to refuse to review detailed software requirements documents, or even try out new features, until after the release
 * Ability to act surprised that the new software that one has never touched acts differently than one's expectations
 * Ability to blame engineers for not being able to read minds

I mean seriously people, don't you think that an open process of submitting feature enhancement requests, voting on the most valuable ones, and then have an expandable pool of resources available to work on them would do just as well at developing software?

= Details =

Of course, one of the tricks is to ensure that an open source development process produces software of the same high quality as proprietary processes.  Because proprietary processes _always_ produce high quality software, correct?  Then again, you never really know for sure because you can't see the source code.  Does this make sense:  Acme Medical Software produces very high-quality code, and you know this because Acme Medical Software told you so.  Is this a scientific approach to software development?
