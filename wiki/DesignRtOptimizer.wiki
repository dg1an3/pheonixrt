#summary RtOptimizer library design

= Introduction =

The RtOptimizer library contains the code for performing the actual optimization


= Details =

In the process of converting the optimizier to use the vnl optimization base.  Unfortunately the vnl conjugate gradient optimizer has no "hook" to be able to compute the dynamic covariance, so a completely separate DynamicCovarianceOptimizer is being used.  Also a DynamicCovarianceCostFunction implements those parts of the cost function that are specific to the DynamicCovariance technique.
