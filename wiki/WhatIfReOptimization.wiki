#summary One approach for incorporating novel optimization algorithms in clinical processes is to use as verification for existing optimizations

= Introduction =

"What-if" re-optimization asks the question: Given some additional information, how much better could an optimization become?  This may not be the same as re-optimizing as part of a replanning step, because the replanning may involve significantly more effort.  But if there is a means to quickly and easily perform a re-optimization based on additional data, then this could serve to aid the replanning decision process.
